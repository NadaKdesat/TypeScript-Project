To-Do List for University Library Management
This project aims to streamline task management for university students and library owners. Users can add tasks with a title, status, start date, and end date. All tasks are stored in local storage to ensure data persistence. Additionally, users can edit or delete tasks after creation, providing a flexible and user-friendly experience.
